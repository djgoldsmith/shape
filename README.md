# Teaching materials for Shape (May 2018)

Guys, these are the teaching materals for my sessions in May.
Most of the code examples we did during the lessions are also included.

Some PRO TIPS (TM) for getting on with the coding

 - Yes I know we have the final solution on avaiable, but "cheating" wont help
 - Go back through the lecture slides:
    - Try to remember the things I talked about
	- Yes, I know, There was quite a lot of extra stuff that we
      discussed, but hopefully the slides will remind you what we did.
      (perhaps next year I can record the lectures)
    - Work throug the examples one by one, 95% of learning to code is
      practice, and being familiar with your coding environment.  The
      other 5% is technical thinking.
 
 - Work hard, keep trying and it will become easy.
 
## Making Changes to the Code
I think I have set the repository to be read only for you.  If you
want to make changes and save them, I would recommend Forking the
repository.  This will create your own "Clone" of the repo to work
with.  See <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/> for more
details on Forking.

If you make something Awesome with the code, let me know. Send me a
"pull request" with details of the project.  You never know, I may use
it as an exampe to Inspire the students next time.
 
## Contacting Me

 - Work Email is aa9863@coventry.ac.uk feel free to ask if you have a
   problem specific to the stuff I taught.  I wont be able to help
   with coursework specific stuff, as you have different tasks than my
   students.  The last thing I want to do is give you the wrong
   advice.
 
 - We are not allowed to give out personal e-mails, but perhaps, if
   you do a usablity test of the Github site.....
